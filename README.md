## Overview
- Privacy has become a myth nowadays and you're getting monitored everywhere. So, this is a next gen social app which focuses on privacy. 
- Here, you get to meet like minded people without revealing your original identity. You can be a part of a group who all focus on one topic. 

## How does it work?
- First, ypu get a [semaphore](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/guides/identities) identity.
- Then you have to create a group. You get a choice to create a group based on some credntials. That credentials can be twitter or github followers. 

## Why does it matter and how does it help?
- Let's say you want to hire a BD person for your company and you make a job application on a careers page of your company. There are very high chances that you'll get many not so great applications. By leveraging zk-soc, you just create a group, specify your desired number of twitter followers that a personn should have and create a [bandada](https://bandada.pse.dev/) group.
- Once you create a group, you only get selected people as bandada verifies whether that person matches the criteria or not. Based upon that you get an entry into the group. You can have a chat with them and easily and make your new hire. You can also have quality developers contributing to your repository making significant changes to your project.
